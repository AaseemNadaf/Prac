Algorithm Steps:- 
1. Read the input value of n, which represents the size of the matrix. 2. Create an "n x n" matrix to store the numbers. 
3. Initialize an array of size n, called "usedNumbers", to keep track of which numbers havebeen used in each row. 
4. Repeat the following steps for each row (i): 
a. Initialize the usedNumbers array to all zeros. 
b. Repeat the following steps for each column (j): 
- Generate a random number between 1 and n that hasn't been used in the current roworcolumn. 
- Assign the generated number to the matrix[i][j]. 
- Mark the used number as used in the usedNumbers array. 
5. Print the generated matrix. 
6. End the algorithm.
