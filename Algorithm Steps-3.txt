Algorithm Steps:- 
1. Read the input: graph (represented as an adjacency list or matrix), start node, goal node. 2. Create an empty queue data structure for BFS. 
3. Enqueue the start node into the queue. 
4. Create a set or array to keep track of visited nodes. 
5. While the queue is not empty: 
a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue. 
b. If the dequeued node is the goal node, terminate and return the path. c. If the dequeued node is not in the visited set: 
- Mark the node as visited. 
- Enqueue all unvisited neighbors of the dequeued node into the queue. - Assign the path to the neighbors to include the current dequeued node. 
6. If the queue becomes empty and the goal node is not found, return "Goal not reachable."7. End the algorithm
