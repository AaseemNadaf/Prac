Algorithm Steps:- 
1. Initialize Parameters: 
● Set the initial temperature (T) for the annealing process. 
● Define the cooling rate (alpha), which controls how fast the temperature decreases. ● Choose the number of iterations or steps per temperature (num_steps). ● Set the initial solution as a random value within the bounds [-5, 5]. 
2. Define the Objective Function: 
● Define the 1-D objective function you want to optimize, in this case, f(x) =x^2. 
3. Initialization: 
● Initialize the current solution as the initial random value. ● Evaluate the objective function at the current solution to get the current energy(E_current). 
● 
4.Annealing Loop: 
A ) Start a loop that iterates over different temperatures (T), decreasing the temperatureusing the cooling rate (alpha) in each iteration. 
B) For each temperature iteration: 
1. Run the following loop for num_steps: 
● Generate a random neighbor solution by perturbing the current solution. ● This can be done by adding a random value within a certain rangetothecurrent solution. 
● Clip the neighbor solution to ensure it stays within the bounds [-5, 5]. ● Evaluate the objective function at the neighbor solution to get the neighbor'senergy (E_neighbor).
● Calculate the energy difference (delta_E) between E_neighbor andE_current.
● If delta_E is negative (neighbor solution is better), accept the neighbor solution and update E_current and the current solution. 
● If delta_E is positive (neighbor solution is worse), accept the neighbor solution with a probability of exp(-delta_E / T). This step introducesrandomness and allows the algorithm to escape local optima. 
C) After the num_steps iterations at the current temperature, the temperature is decreasedusing the cooling rate (alpha). 
5.Termination Condition: 
The annealing process can terminate based on various conditions, such as a predefinednumber of temperature iterations or when the temperature becomes very low(closetozero). 
6. Output: The final solution found by the algorithm is the optimized value of x that corresponds to the global or near-global minimum of the objective function.
